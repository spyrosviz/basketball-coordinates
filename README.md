# basketball-coordinates
This data app can be used by anyone who wants to create his own basketball match dataset.
You can insert teams and players of the match and while watching a basketball game you can 
annotate the coordinates for each shooting event by clicking on the respective point on the
basketball graph while selecting other information related to the shooting event 
(shot type, made or missed, under pressure or not etc..). After selecting information about
each event you can add it into the table below and at the end of the match you can extract
the table in an excel format so you can make whatever analysis you want with the data such as
shot accuracy per zone, percentage of shot types per player etc.
The app can be found in [https://extract-basketball-coordinates-data-app.onrender.com](https://extract-basketball-coordinates-data-app.onrender.com).
It may take several seconds to load.
